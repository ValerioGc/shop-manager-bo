<h2 id="installation">üõ†Ô∏è Installation Step:</h2>

##### 1. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

##### 2. Update dependencies

```sh
npm update
```

##### 3. Compile for development (_Opens the website locally_)

```sh
npm run dev
```

##### 4. Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

<br/>

<h2 id="wiki">üìñ WIKI</h2>

General wiki for the project. Console commands, procedures, and links to services.

<br/>

<h2 id="test">üß™ Unit Test <a src="https://vitest.dev">[Vitest]</a></h2>
The testing process is already integrated into the build script and pipelines. However, it is possible to run tests in standalone mode with the following command:

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

<br/>

<h2 id="build">üî® Build and Optimization for Deploy</h2>

There are several build processes based on the environment that can be used with these commands:

#### 1. Execute the build using the production .env files

```sh
npm run build:dev
```

#### 2. Execute the build using the production .env files

```sh
npm run build:prod
```

#### 3. Execute the build using the test .env files

```sh
npm run build:test
```

#### 5. Execute the build using the production .env files

```sh
npm run build:prod
```

<br/>

<h2 id="branch">üå± Branch Rules</h2>

_The deploy branches are divided by environment. On push to the deploy_prod/test branch, the pipeline is triggered. The branches should only be used for releases in CI/CD with Github Action and Plesk_
[See üß®Deploy section](#deploy)

- **dev**: Development and testing branch
- **deploy_test**: branch for release in the test environment
- **deploy_prod**: branch for release in the production environment

<br/>

<h2 id="deploy">üöÄ Deploy</h2>

The release is performed via pipeline on GitHub actions.
[See the üõ†Ô∏èBuild section](#build)

It executes the webhook to notify Plesk (deployment manager) of the new version of the deploy.
The test pipeline is simplified. It builds and updates the test branch.

#### **Pipeline**:

- TEST_deploy_pipeline_ci
- PROD_deploy_pipeline_ci

<br/>

### **Deploy Script**

The deployment process is automated through scripts that can be used via NodeJS commands.

**Start the production pipeline on GitHub actions.**

```
npm run deploy:prod
```

<br/>

**Start the test pipeline on GitHub actions.**

```
npm run deploy:test
```

<br/>

### **Deploy Procedure for CI/CD Pipeline**

- Commit all changes to the dev branch and push
- Change branch depending on where you want to release `git checkout deploy_prod / checkout deploy_test` [_see branch section_](#branch)
- Pull the latest changes
- Merge with the command `git merge dev`
- Commit and push

### _Manual Release Procedure on Plesk Environment_

- Access the **Plesk panel** with the [link](https://web.plutone.vhosting-it.com:8443/login_up.php).
- Insert the user credentials and log in.
- Selezionare dal menu laterale il tab **'File'**.
- Navigare nella cartella **admin.shop.com** per il sito di <ins>produzione</ins> e **admin-test.shop.com** for the <ins>test</ins> environment.
- use the **build procedure** mentioned in the section [üî®Build and Optimization](#build) of the readme file.
- **Remove the files** in the destination folder and copy all the contents of the **dist** folder present in the project.
- Clean cache and browser data.

<h2 id="docker">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Docker_%28container_engine%29_logo.svg" /> 
</h2>

The project uses docker to run the application and perform other operations without having to install NodeJs locally. The script compiles for development using a nodeJs:alpine environment via Docker.

**Start the project with docker on Windows environments**

```bash
npm run docker:win
```

**Start the project with docker on Linux environments**

```bash
npm run docker:linux
```

<br/>

There is also a docker script for running the compiled application in production on VPS/VM using a nodeJs:alpine instance.

**Start the project with docker in test mode**

```bash
npm run docker:deploy -- {mode}
```

##### _Available modes_:

> - development
> - test
> - prod

<br/>

<h2 id="cloudT"> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Google_%22G%22_logo.svg" width="22x" align="center" height="22px" /> Google Translate</h2>

The back office panel uses the text translation service offered by Google Cloud. <br/>
The service is Cloud translate API (_Cloud translation - BASIC_) <br/>
It has a limit of 500,000 characters per month for free and has a maximum number of characters per request. <br/>
The service use an **API KEY** that is saved in the **.env.production** and **env.test** files of the [back end project](https://github.com/ValerioGc/laravel-store-manager)
