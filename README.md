## üöÄ Github Actions

The project is integrated with GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline is triggered on every push to the deploy_prod/deploy_test branch. The pipeline includes the following steps:

- **Version and changelog extraction**: The version and changelog are extracted from the package.json file to be used in the release process.
- **Build**: The project is built using the build script.
- **Test**: The project is tested using the test script.
- **Deploy**: The compiled build is deployed to the production/test branch.
- **Sitemap**: The sitemap is generated using the sitemap script.
- **Github release**: The project is released on GitHub using the release script and **tagged with version numbers**.

### **Deploy Script**

The deployment process is automated through scripts that can be used via NodeJS commands.

**Start the production pipeline on GitHub actions.**

```
npm run deploy:prod
```

<br/>

**Start the test pipeline on GitHub actions.**

```
npm run deploy:test
```

<br/>

<h2 id="docker">Docker integration</h2>

The project uses Docker to run the application and perform other operations without having NodeJs installed locally. The script compiles for development using a nodeJs:alpine environment via Docker.

**Start the project with docker on Windows environments**

```bash
npm run docker:win
```

**Start the project with docker on Linux environments**

```bash
npm run docker:linux
```

<br/>

It's also present a docker script for running the compiled files on VPS/VM on nodeJs:alpine instance

**Start the project with docker in test mode**

```bash
npm run docker:deploy -- {mode}
```
